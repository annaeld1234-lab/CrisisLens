### Project Description
[CrisisLens is a web-based platform designed to detect, analyze, and visualize crisis situations in real-time. It helps users report emergencies, view nearby crisis alerts, and receive rapid response guidance using AI-powered analysis. The system aims to improve public safety and response coordination during disasters or emergency situations.]

### The Problem statement
[During emergencies, people often lack:

Real-time verified crisis information

Proper reporting platforms

Immediate safety guidance

CrisisLens solves this by providing a centralized digital crisis monitoring system.]

*Processed Cases shows the total number of incidents analyzed by the system.

Critical represents emergency situations that require immediate action.

High indicates serious cases that need urgent attention.

Medium shows moderate incidents that require monitoring.

Duplicates counts repeated or similar reports detected by the system.

Tracked displays the number of incidents currently being monitored.

Live Feed provides real-time updates of incoming disaster reports.
